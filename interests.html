		<p style = "font-size: 14px">I am not the biggest fan of roller skating.
		I like to try and experience new things in life. Therefore, my friends
		and I deciced to try roller skating in a roller skating area near my house.
		I would say learning this sport takes time and patience. Its a fun sport
		and activity.</p>
	</td>
	<td>
		<p style = "font-size: 14px">I love ice skating. It hasn't been that long
		since I learned the sport, but its very fun and interesting. When I first
		tried on ice skates, I had trouble adjusting with it, increasing my interest
		in the sport. Overtime, I learned to walk, jump, and even run. When I got on
		the ice, I wanted to learn it. So far, this is my favourite hobby.</p>
	</td>
	<td>
		<p style = "font-size: 14px">Taek-won-do is a very aggressive sport. It helps
		you in real-life situations where you have to protect yourself (self-defense).
		I have learned Taek-won-do for 5 years now (black-belt martial artist).</p>
	</td>
	<td>
		<p style = "font-size: 14px">I have always been passionate for cooking. Any time
		I cook, I feel a sense of relaxation and accomplishment. Cooking puts me in a "flow
		state", where I'm fully immersed & enjoying the present. The feeling of
		creating something from scratch is incredibly rewarding. Cooking allows you to learn
		new techniques, expand your culinary range, and travel the world through different
		cuisines.</p>
	</td>
	<td>
		<p style = "font-size: 14px">I like playing/watching soccer with my family and friends.
		There is always a thrill of scoring a goal, the excitement of a game, and the overall
		experience of playing soccer is deeply satisfying. Soccer is a fun way to enjoy the oudoors,
		get healthy exercise with friends, and build lasting relationships.</p>
	</td>
	<td>
		<p style = "font-size: 14px">Volleyball is my favourite sport. I always play it with my
		friends. Every weekend, I play with my friends and their families in the park. It requires
		a wide range of athletic skills, including jumping, agility, quick reflexes, and hand-eye
		coordination. Volleyball can be played by individuals of all ages and skill levels, and can
		be played indoors or outdoors.</p>
	</td>
	<td>
		<p style = "font-size: 14px">I find reading as a mix of entertainment, learning, and mental
		stimulation. I find more interest in reading fictional/mystery books. Reading books helps
		reduce stress and calm the mind. Books can enhance reading comprehension and critical thinking
		skills - as readers analyze information and make connections.</p>
