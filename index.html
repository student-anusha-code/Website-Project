<h1 style = "font-family:Brush Script MT">All About Me: Portfolio</h1>

<p style = "font-size: 17px"> I have always been an energetic person, therefore my parents
decided to give me friends that can match my energy. Now, I have a pet dog and a cat. Most
people can choose between these two animals, but I can't. I love both cats and dogs. I could
never pick one over the other. Yes, its tiring having to walk them and take care of every
mistake they make around the house, but they are good company and I enjoy every moment with them.
I study at Victoria Park Collegiate Institute. I usually like to keep my friend group small during.
I don't have much of a loud personality. My bestfriend frequently comes over to my house, to
hang-out with me and my pets.</p>

	<p style = "font-size: 17px">I got him when I was 8 years old; I named him Lucky. He was me and my family's first pet.
	Everyone adored him a lot; whenever my relatives/extended family came, they always played with him. Since he was little,
	he was always excited and energetic with everyone. He was always by my side, never giving me time to get bored. With his
	company by my side, I had a feeling of getting another pet for both of us.</p>

	<p style = "font-size: 17px">I got her when I was 11 years old; I named her Lily. After spending time with Lucky, I wanted
	another pet so that Lucky can have a friend who can play with him. When Lily was first brought
	into our home, both pets were distant with each other, but as time went by, they became closer.
	Its usually said and belived that cats and dogs don't go well with each other, but Lucky and
	Lily seem to be fine with each other.</p>
